## Chicago Assistant

The Chicago Assistant is a text and voice interface for requesting city services and making inquires about city services. Functionalities we are currently exploring include:
 - Submit 311 Service Requests
 - Get transit arrival times and station accessibility information
 - Request information about common city services such as getting a vehicle city sticker, school closures, street cleaning schedules, etc.
 - Contacting your alderman
 - Got an idea? [Share it with us!](google.com)

The text and voice interface could be integrated with popular messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger and popular voice interfaces like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

The project aims to improve ease of accessibility to city services and information about city services by creating a text and voice channel to compliment existing web and telephone (311) channels.
